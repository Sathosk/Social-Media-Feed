## How it was made

Building this project was a thrilling journey. I used MongoDB as the database, Express as the backend framework, Vue as the frontend framework, and Node as the runtime environment. Additionally, I utilized Mongoose for database modeling, Multer for handling file uploads, Cloudinary for cloud-based image and video management, Jest for testing and Supertest to test the http endpoints. It was challenging to bring all these technologies together, but the result is a fully functional social media feed simulation that's ready to be used.

## Lessons Learned

During this project, I learned a lot about building full-stack application, such as the integration of different technologies like Vue, SCSS, Multer, Cloudinary, Jest. I also improved my skills in building RESTful API and managing state on the frontend. This project was a great learning experience and I am excited to continue developing my skills in full-stack development.
